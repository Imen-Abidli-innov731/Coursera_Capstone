#Analyzing the severity of car accidents
#Introduction : Traffic accidents represent one among the leading causes of death worldwide and of economic expenditure.The target of this project is car drivers, the project will inform them about under which conditions they have to be more caution. If the drivers are more caution under dangerous conditions, there'll be less accidents occur.
#1. A description of the problem : The project aims to predict how severity of accidents can be reduced based on a few factors and What are the factors that have a high impact on road accidents.
#2. Discussion of the background : In an attempt to scale back the frequency of car collisions during a community, a model must be developed to predict the severity of an accident.
#the current weather, road,visibility and speeding conditions. When conditions are bad, this model will alert drivers to remind them to be more careful.


python
#Description of Data : For an accurate prediction of the magnitude of injury caused by accidents, they require an outsized number of reports on traffic accidents with accurate data to train prediction models.
#This data is regarding the severity of each car accidents along with the time and conditions under which each accident occurred.
#The data set provided for this work in which 37 attributes or variables are recorded and the codification of the type of accident is allowed, grouped according to 84 codes gives us an idea on
#speed information, information on road conditions and visibility,type of collision.
